# finding a level02.pcap file 

send it to my kali linux machine to decrypt it 
	scp level02.pcap kali@10.13.100.235:~


# what we have 

when we log to level02 home we fin a pcap file which contains a packet of data captured over a network 

we looked for a method to analyse the pcap data with wireshark 

# first of all 

we can just change the permission of the file so evryyone can read or write in it 

# how to anallyse .pcap files 

using Wireshark which is a network packet analyzer.or The Wireshark Network Sniffer that gives the network administrator deep insight into network activity. 

# using the telnet capture password 

elnet protocol using port tcp/23. It is mainly used for administrative convenience and is known for its insecurity. Since encryption is not available, privacy or unauthorized access protection is not available 

# seeing the hexadecimal of the printable password 

we can see evrything enter the user after the password prompt when we look at these characters on the iscii table will see 4 charachters . not printable in ascii 

so there is ft_waNderLOL is tha password for flag02 

# entring tha passeord 

ft_waNDReL0L

is the password after deleting what we  to deleted charachters before .
