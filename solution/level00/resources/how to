first step is to find files owned by the user we r trying to log into. to find all files owned by a specific user we use this command and redirect errors to dev/null:
    find / -user flag00  2>/dev/null

output:
    /usr/sbin/john
    /rofs/usr/sbin/john

content of john gives:
    cdiiddwpgswtgt

trying to authenticate using that string fails, so the next thing to try is to decipher it, first we find out which cipher will most likely work, using this cipher identifier:
    https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier

first recommanded cipher is caesar, which outputs this as first result:
    nottoohardhere

now let's log in and get the flag:
    level00@SnowCrash:~$ su flag00
    Password:
    Don't forget to launch getflag !
    flag00@SnowCrash:~$ getflag
    Check flag.Here is your token : x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias
